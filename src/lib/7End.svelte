<p>As you can see, the supposed benefits of hosting the Olympics rarely pay off for a host city's private citizens. It's not surprising that, especially in light of this year's devastating wildfires, the people of Los Angeles don't feel ready to host in three years. <br> <br> Luckily, the Olympics also has a long history of citizen mobilization against Olympic bids. In 1972, Denver citizens <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2022/01/23/denver-olympics-1976-voter-referendum/">organized</a> against the 1976 Olympic bid, citing economic and environmental reasons, and successfully rejected the Games. More recently, both <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/local/2024-07-19/no-boston-olympics-reflects-on-its-victory-nine-years-ago">Boston</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/calgary-2026-plebiscite-jamie-strashin-1.4904585">Calgary</a> pulled out of bids for 2024 and 2026 respectively due to economic concerns about the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2016/07/the-cost-to-cities-of-hosting-the-olympics-since-1964/">increasingly expensive</a> event.</p>
