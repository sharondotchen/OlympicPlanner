            Townsville city officials use the event as a chance to champion their “recovery” narrative, but the festival ends up costing more than normal to accommodate for outbreak-related adjustments, and infection rates increase regardless.

            The Japanese government would agree with your decision.

            The 2021 Tokyo Olympics, originally slated for 2020, were postponed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as the Games approached, nine prefectures including Tokyo were still under a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/world/asia/japan-covid-emergency-olympics.html">state of emergency</a>, and citizens and medical professionals alike urged the Games' cancellation. Anti-Olympic activist group Hangorin No Kai (反五輪の会) also <a href="https://prismreports.org/2024/09/05/los-angeles-olympics-protests/">invoked</a> the harmful legacy of displacement from the 1964 Games, highlighting the stories of roughly 200 families who were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sad-lonely-feeling-tokyo-man-evicted-twice-50-years-apart-olympic-construction-2021-07-01/">evicted</a> from public housing in 2013 due to Olympics-related construction — several of whom had also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sad-lonely-feeling-tokyo-man-evicted-twice-50-years-apart-olympic-construction-2021-07-01/">faced</a> eviction ahead of the 1964 Olympics. Unlike Townsville, Japan had a significant aging population, a severe shortage of medical professionals, and only an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/olympics/ahead-tokyo-olympics-japan-vaccination-rate-far-mark-n1272523">8%</a> vaccination rate just one month away from the Games (compared to 45% in the U.S. and 10% per country on average worldwide).
        <br><br>
        Despite these serious concerns, the 2021 Olympics proceeded as planned. As expected, COVID cases <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/08/06/japan-covid-surge-olympics/">surged</a> to record rates during the Games. In fact, the Japanese government <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/tokyo-covered-arrival-deadly-covid-103011468.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAZtATQ50MiCzjZagurcjoL2TtS7Kid_9JIPYQrOu8TWfQ96xn9tOLyRXJabNo2ZmbTW0nBIlnc6Y7pWhAW6YNdLeeZugMsbrAnBpKQG87W8OXG5t5MLwI4lIdFH_NSL5QnCyKygYJsAloQH0zZ7ZEaffuznEhzzpRKzPlzxUDS_">deliberately delayed announcing</a> a deadly new COVID variant because of the Olympics. Furthermore, half a million potentially life-saving COVID tests <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-lifestyle-technology-sports-japan-olympic-team-0645e7853f6b152729ba80f332cd0fa7">flowed</a> into the Olympic village throughout the two-week duration of the Olympics, while the Japanese public confronted testing kit shortages. Although International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/aug/06/thomas-bach-praises-soul-of-tokyo-olympics-but-faces-twitter-backlash">called</a> Tokyo “the best-ever prepared Olympic city,” for the most part, the Japanese public vehemently disagreed. </p>
